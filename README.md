Enhance your Ollama deployment with enterprise-grade AI security using Palo Alto Networks AI Runtime Security.

## What is this?

panw-api-ollama is a security proxy that sits between your [OpenWebUI](https://openwebui.com/) interface and [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance. It works by intercepting all prompts and responses, analyzing them with Palo Alto Networks' AI RUNTIME security technology, and protecting your system from:

- Prompt injection attacks
- Data exfiltration attempts
- Harmful or toxic content
- Personally identifiable information (PII) leakage
- Other AI-specific security threats

The best part? It's completely transparent to your existing setup - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) will still work just as before, but with an added layer of security.

## Why use this?

- **Prevent Security Incidents**: Detect and block malicious prompts before they reach your LLM
- **Protect Sensitive Data**: Ensure responses don't contain unauthorized information
- **Maintain Compliance**: Implement guardrails for safe AI usage in enterprise environments
- **Visibility**: Gain insights into usage patterns and potential threats

## Use Cases

- **Secure AI models in production**: Validate prompt requests and responses to protect deployed AI models.
- **Detect data poisoning**: Identify contaminated training data before fine-tuning.
- **Protect adversarial input**: Safeguard AI agents from malicious inputs and outputs while maintaining workflow flexibility.
- **Prevent sensitive data leakage**: Use API-based threat detection to block sensitive data leaks during AI interactions.

## Docker Setup

For Docker-based deployment, please refer to the instructions in the [Docker Setup README](docker/README.md).

The Docker setup provides a complete stack with Ollama, panw-api-ollama, and OpenWebUI in a pre-configured environment.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install

```
git clone https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/panw-api-ollama.git
cd panw-api-ollama
cargo build --release
```

### Step 2: Get a Palo Alto Networks API Key

Follow [this tutorial](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/ai-runtime-security/activation-and-onboarding/ai-runtime-security-api-intercept-overview/onboard-api-runtime-security-api-intercept-in-scm), specifically step 13, to obtain your API key.

### Step 3: Configure

Rename `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and update it with your API key:

```
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
```

Then edit the file to add your Palo Alto Networks API key:

```yaml
pan_api:
  key: "your-pan-api-key-here"
```

### Step 4: Update OpenWebUI

For non-Docker installations, you need to change the Ollama port in OpenWebUI from 11434 to 11435:

1. Go to Settings > Server Management in the OpenWebUI interface
2. Add a new Ollama server with URL: `http://localhost:11435` 
3. Save your configuration

Alternatively, update your OpenWebUI environment settings:
[OpenWebUI Environment Configuration](https://docs.openwebui.com/getting-started/env-configuration#ollama_base_urls)

### Step 5: Download a model

Before using the service, make sure you have a model available:

```bash
ollama pull llama2-uncensored:latest
```

### Step 6: Run

```bash
./target/release/panw-api-ollama
```

You're all set! You can now use OpenWebUI as normal, but with enterprise security scanning all interactions.

## Configuration Examples

The project includes example configuration files in the `config-examples` directory that demonstrate different setup options:

### OpenWebUI Global Configuration

The `config-1747909231428.json` file shows how to set up OpenWebUI with both secured and unsecured Ollama connections:

```json
{
    "ollama": {
        "enable": true,
        "base_urls": [
            "http://panw-api-ollama:11435",  // Secure connection through panw-api-ollama
            "http://host.docker.internal:11434"  // Direct connection to Ollama
        ],
        "api_configs": {
            "0": {
                "enable": true,
                "tags": [],
                "prefix_id": "PANW",  // Models with this prefix use the security proxy
                "model_ids": [
                    "llama2-uncensored:latest"
                ],
                "key": ""
            },
            "1": {
                "enable": true,
                "tags": [],
                "prefix_id": "NOPAWN",  // Models with this prefix bypass the security proxy
                "model_ids": [
                    "nomic-embed-text:latest",
                    "llama2-uncensored:latest"
                ],
                "key": ""
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Model Configurations

Two example model configurations are included to demonstrate before/after comparisons:

1. `PANW.llama2-uncensored_latest-1747909321539.json` - A model using the security proxy
2. `NOPAWN.llama2-uncensored_latest-1747909327080.json` - The same model bypassing the security proxy

These configurations allow you to perform side-by-side comparisons and demonstrations of how the Palo Alto Networks AI Runtime Security affects the model responses.
